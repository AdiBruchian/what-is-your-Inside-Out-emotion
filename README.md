# what-is-your-Inside-Out-emotion

## Overview
This project explores and compares various dropout methods for improving the generalization of deep neural networks. Specifically, we focus on evaluating the effectiveness of different dropout techniques in the context of emotion classification using the ResNet-18 architecture on the FER13 dataset.

## Methodology
1- Each dropout method was tested with various parameters on the **validation set** to identify the best-performing configuration.
2 - The best parameters were then used to evaluate performance on the test set.

## Dataset
We use the FER13 dataset, which contains grayscale images classified into seven distinct emotions.
